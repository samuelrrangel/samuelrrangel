### Hi there 👋

## I'm a developer from Brazil. Passionate for programming, _Linux_, problem solving and ✨ _learning_ ✨.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Fênix Robótica](https://github.com/r47orr/fenix-robotica-js) and [Math](https://github.com/r47orr/math).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, C# and improving on JavaScript.
- 👀 I'm very interested on Linux and I'm all the time taking a look at [Linux Kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux).
- 👯 I'd love being be able to collaborate to the [Linux Kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), but I'm still far from that.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an official translator for Steam and for other projects.
