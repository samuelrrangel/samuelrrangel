### Hi there 👋

# My name is Samuel. I'm a developer from Brazil. Passionate for programming, _Linux_, problem solving and ✨ _learning_ ✨.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some hobby projects, such as (Fênix Robótica)[https://github.com/r47orr/fenix-robotica-js] and (Math)[https://github.com/r47orr/math].
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, C# and improving on JavaScript
- 👀 I'm very interested on Linux and I'm all the time taking a look at (Linux Kernel)[https://github.com/torvalds/linux]
- 👯 I'd love to be able to collaborate to the (Linux Kernel)[https://github.com/torvalds/linux], but I'm still very far from having that level
